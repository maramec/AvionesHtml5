According to fighter ace J.E. \"Johnnie\" Johnson it was the best conventional defensive fighter of the war.As the war continued, however, the fighter evolved into a multi-role aircraft capable of operating in different environments.[4] For example, the Spitfire was a pioneer in the role of the unarmed, photo reconnaissance (P.R) aircraft which relied on high speed and high altitude to avoid detection and avoid attack."},
